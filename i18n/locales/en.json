    "p1": "Once upon a time, there was a mountain. On the mountain stood a home, and in the home lived many old souls. They might have been part of a building, or once been members of a household, carrying their own unique marks. The precipitation of time has not only made them mature, but also endowed them with a unique charm and soul. Although they have aged, what others see as tattered rags is our brocade. We love to converse with time and feel wear of the years. Likewise, we cherish these treasures from the long river of time.",
    "p2": "Here, every item is not merely an exhibit, but an expression of our philosophy. If you share the same love, welcome to the Mountain Home."
